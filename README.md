# videocorpus - Resources for Named Entity Linking Performance Evaluation: Corpora Extracted from Transcripts

This project contains the following:

**RBB150** 

Currently it contains 150 documents collected from RBB transcripts.

It contains several folders:
- **tutorial** - short GATE tutorial used by the annotators
- **guideline** - annotation guideline
- **subs** - raw subtitles / transcripts
- **ontology** - original and enriched ontology (created by automatically adding subtypes to the original ontology)
- **gold** - gold standards in various formats (csv, nif, etc).

The RBB transcripts represent a set of local news items from Berlin and Brandenburg, and are focused on a wide array of news topics 
such as floods, traffic jams, immigration, sports and political events, and local administration. 

Due to the regionality of the content, the corpus itself contains frequent use of shortened names for entities, direct or indirect references 
to local or historical events (e.g. anniversaries of the 1953 East German Uprising or of Kennedy\emph{'}s visit to Berlin from 1963).
