# videocorpus - Resources for Named Entity Linking Performance Evaluation: Corpora Extracted from Transcripts

This project contains the following:

## RBB150 

Currently it contains 150 documents collected from RBB transcripts.

It contains several folders:
- **tutorial** - short GATE tutorial used by the annotators
- **guideline** - annotation guideline
- **subs** - raw subtitles / transcripts
- **ontology** - original and enriched ontology (created by automatically adding subtypes to the original ontology)
- **gold** - gold standards in various formats (csv, nif, etc).

**Regionality**: content from Berlin and Brandenburg.

**News topics**: floods, traffic jams, immigration, sports and political events, and local administration. 

Due to the regionality of the content, the corpus also contains frequent use of shortened names for entities, direct or indirect references 
to local (elections) or historical events (e.g. anniversaries of the 1953 East German Uprising or of Kennedy's visit to Berlin from 1963).
