The gold standard is provided in multiple formats.

The name of the file indicates format and type of gold:

* all/full - all entity types
* main/kbp - Person, Organisation, Location
* [all/full or main/kbp] + nonils - indicates datasets that are ok for GERBIL evaluations (provided they're in NIF format)

For split-by-type evaluations use CSV format.

For GERBIL evaluations is enough to simply drop the NIF file in GERBIL and set the desired annotators.
